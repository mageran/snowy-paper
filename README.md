This is a demo project using React/Vite/Redux that implements a generic component in the finance domain. The component creates generic widgets for collections of so-called "monetary entities", which describes entities that have a money amount and a status attached to it. Examples are Invoices, which obviously have an amount, and can be in different states, like "draft", "awaiting payment", "past due", "paid" etc. . Another example would be payments, which can have status values like "reconciled", "matched", "mismatched" in the context of AR, for instance.
